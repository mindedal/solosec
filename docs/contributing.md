## Development environment

Warden uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency and environment
management. From a clone:

```bash
uv sync --python 3.11
```

This creates a virtual environment with the runtime and development
dependencies. To reproduce CI exactly, install from the lockfile without
updating it:

```bash
uv sync --frozen
```

Run the CLI from the checkout without installing it:

```bash
uv run warden --help
```

## The quality gate

Four checks, each run by CI in this order. Run them locally before pushing:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
uv run pytest
```

To apply formatting rather than only check it:

```bash
uv run ruff format .
```

### What each check enforces

| Check | Configured in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ruff format` | `[tool.ruff.format]` | 100-character lines, double quotes, spaces. |
| `ruff check` | `[tool.ruff.lint]` | Rule sets `B`, `E`, `F`, `I`, `UP`, `W`. Import sorting is included via `I`. |
| `pyright` | `[tool.pyright]` | **Strict mode.** Targets Python 3.11 across `src` and `tests`. |
| `pytest` | `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` | Tests live in `tests/`, with `src` on the path. |

Pyright runs in strict mode, so new code needs complete type annotations.
`reportUnnecessaryTypeIgnoreComment` is on, meaning a `# type: ignore` that is
no longer needed is itself an error.

## Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Tests live in `tests/`, with static tool output in `tests/fixtures/`. The
fixtures are small hand-written samples of each scanner's JSON, used to exercise
parsing and severity normalisation without running the real scanners. Command
execution is injected rather than patched: tests pass the recording
`CommandRunner` in `tests/fakes.py` and assert on the command line that was
built, so the suite runs without Trivy, Semgrep, Gitleaks, or Docker installed.

When adding support for a new field or tool, add a fixture rather than reaching
for a live scan — it keeps the suite fast and deterministic.

`pytest-cov` is available for coverage runs:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=warden
```

## Dependencies

Runtime dependencies are declared in `[project.dependencies]`; development tools
in `[dependency-groups]`. Add one with:

```bash
uv add <package>
uv add --dev <package>
```

Two constraints in `[tool.uv]` are deliberate and will affect you:

- **`exclude-newer = "7 days"`** — a dependency cooldown. Distributions published
  in the last seven days are not resolvable, so a freshly-published release
  cannot be pulled in silently. If a lock fails on a very recent version, this is
  why; wait for it to age out rather than removing the setting.
- **`override-dependencies = ["mcp>=1.28.1"]`** — Semgrep pins `mcp==1.23.3`,
  which carries known advisories. Warden uses Semgrep's CLI scanner and never
  its MCP server, so the pin is overridden to the patched release.

Commit `uv.lock` alongside any dependency change.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pushes to `main`, on pull requests, and on
manual dispatch:

- **`quality`** — the four checks above on Ubuntu with Python 3.11.
- **`scan`** — runs Warden against this repository, gated on `quality` passing.

The `scan` job means the project scans itself: a change that introduces a High
or Critical finding — including in a workflow file or the `Dockerfile` — will
fail CI. See [Using Warden in CI](guides/ci-github-actions.md).

Actions are pinned to commit SHAs with the version in a trailing comment. When
updating one, update both.

## Project conventions

- Public functions are typed; internal helpers are prefixed with `_`.
- Data structures are frozen dataclasses or `TypedDict`s in `_models.py`, kept
  free of logic. A record that needs a derived accessor lives beside the code
  that uses it instead — `Scanner` in `_scanners.py`, `Verdict` in `_summary.py`.
- `tooling.py` is the only module that runs subprocesses. A scanner's command
  line is built by its `Scanner` record; `tooling.run_scanner` is what runs it.
- Adding a scanner means adding a `Scanner` record, its parser, and its command
  builder. If you find yourself editing a second list of tools, the registry
  should have grown a field instead.
- `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of every module.

## Documentation

Documentation lives in `docs/`, organised by purpose: tutorial, how-to guides,
reference, explanation. When adding a document, add it to the table in
[`docs/README.md`](README.md) — that index is the map, and an unlisted file is
an invisible one.

Verify any command you document by running it.
