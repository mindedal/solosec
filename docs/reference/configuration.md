# Configuration reference

Warden is configured from three places, in increasing order of precedence:

1. Built-in defaults
2. `.warden.yaml` in the project root
3. Command-line flags

For task-oriented examples, see [Configuring scans](../guides/configuring-scans.md).

## The config file format is a YAML subset

`.warden.yaml` is **not** parsed by a YAML library. Warden uses a small
hand-written parser that understands only the shapes documented here. This keeps
the tool dependency-free at the config layer, at the cost of rejecting most of
YAML.

What the parser supports:

- Top-level `key: value` scalars
- Exactly one level of nesting, under `exclude_dirs` (a `-` list) and `tools` (a
  mapping)
- `#` comments, including trailing comments, with `\` escaping
- Single or double quoted strings

What it does **not** support: anchors, multi-line strings, nested mappings
deeper than one level, inline `[a, b]` or `{a: b}` collections, or documents
with `---` separators. Unrecognised top-level keys are parsed and then ignored.

A file that cannot be read or parsed is treated as empty — Warden falls back to
defaults rather than reporting an error. A malformed config therefore fails
silently. Verify with `warden-config .` when in doubt.

## Keys

### `target_url`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | string |
| Default | `""` |
| Alias | `url` |

DAST target for OWASP ZAP. When empty, ZAP is skipped.

`url` is accepted as an alias. If both are present, `target_url` wins.

```yaml
target_url: "http://localhost:3000"
```

Overridden by the `--url` flag.

### `exclude_dirs`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | list of strings |
| Default | `[]` |

Paths excluded from the three static scanners. Empty and whitespace-only entries
are dropped.

```yaml
exclude_dirs:
  - "tests/"
  - "vendor/"
```

Each value is passed to every static tool, but the tools interpret exclusions
differently:

| Tool | Flag | Form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trivy | `--skip-dirs` | All values joined with commas into one flag |
| Semgrep | `--exclude` | One flag per value |
| Gitleaks | `--exclude-path` | One flag per value |

Because the semantics differ per tool, a pattern that excludes cleanly in one
scanner may not in another. ZAP scans a URL rather than the filesystem, so
`exclude_dirs` does not affect it.

### `tools`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | mapping of string to boolean |
| Default | all `true` |

Enables or disables individual scanners. Recognised keys are `trivy`,
`semgrep`, `gitleaks`, and `zap`. Any other key is ignored.

```yaml
tools:
  zap: true
  semgrep: true
  gitleaks: false
  trivy: true
```

Booleans are accepted in several forms:

| Value | Parsed as |
| --- | --- |
| `true`, `yes`, `on`, `1` | `true` |
| `false`, `no`, `off`, `0` | `false` |
| any other string | `false` |

Comparison is case-insensitive. Quoted values such as `"true"` are also
accepted.

## Interaction between `target_url` and `tools.zap`

`tools.zap: false` clears the resolved URL entirely. This happens **after** the
CLI flag is applied, so it overrides an explicit `--url`:

```console
$ warden-config . --cli-url "http://example.com"
{"url": "", "exclude_dirs": [...], "tools": {..., "zap": false}}
```

If you pass `--url` and ZAP is skipped anyway, check `tools.zap`.

## Full example

```yaml
target_url: "http://localhost:3000"
exclude_dirs:
  - "tests/"
  - "legacy/"
tools:
  zap: true
  semgrep: true
  gitleaks: false
  trivy: true
```

## Environment variables

Warden reads no environment variables for scanner selection or exclusions —
those come only from the config file and flags. The variables below affect where
the ZAP container mounts its output.

| Variable | Read by | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WARDEN_HOST_REPORT_DIR` | ZAP stage | Absolute host path to mount as ZAP's working directory. Highest precedence. |
| `WARDEN_HOST_WORKSPACE` | ZAP stage | Host path to the project; `.security_reports` under it is mounted. |
| `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` | ZAP stage | Same as above. Set automatically by GitHub Actions. |

These exist because ZAP runs in a sibling container. When Warden is itself
running inside a container, the report path it sees is a container path, which
the Docker daemon cannot mount. These variables supply the *host* path instead.
They are consulted in the order listed; if none is set, the in-process report
directory path is used.

When running Warden directly on your machine, leave all three unset.

The Docker image also sets `HOME`, the `XDG_*` directories, `TRIVY_CACHE_DIR`,
and `SEMGREP_SETTINGS_FILE` to writable paths so the scanners work under an
arbitrary user ID. Those are internal to the image; see
[Running with Docker](../guides/running-with-docker.md#why-the---user-flag-is-required).

## Fixed values

Not configurable, but useful to know:

| Value | Setting |
| --- | --- |
| Failing severities | Critical and High |
| Report directory | `.security_reports/` in the project root |
| Aggregated report | `security_audit.json` in the project root |
| ZAP image | `ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy:stable` |
| Semgrep rules | `--config=auto` (Semgrep's registry-selected rule set) |
| Gitleaks mode | `--no-git` (scans the working tree, not history) |

Note that Gitleaks runs with `--no-git`, so it inspects files as they are on
disk. **Secrets that were committed and later removed are not detected.**
